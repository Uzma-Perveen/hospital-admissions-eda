**🏥 Hospital Admissions Analysis – EDA Project**
This project is a beginner-level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) case study using hospital admission records. It focuses on uncovering patterns in patient admissions that can help optimize scheduling, resource allocation, and patient flow management in healthcare settings.

**🎯 Project Goals**
-Analyze admission trends using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
-Investigate how factors like age, gender, and admission timing influence patient inflow
-Present insights with meaningful visualizations
-Answer essential business questions using historical data

**🧱 Project Workflow**
1️⃣ Setup & Data Loading
Imported essential libraries and loaded the dataset (HDHI Admission data.csv) into a DataFrame for processing.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
-Cleaned column names for consistency
-Converted date fields into datetime objects
-Extracted features like day of the week and age groups

3️⃣ Initial Exploration
Explored data structure with .info(), .describe(), and .head(). Verified data completeness and basic distributions.

4️⃣ Visual & Quantitative EDA
-Bar plots for age groups, gender distribution, and weekday admissions
-Heatmap to compare admission types across genders
-Crosstab summaries and grouping to answer EDA questions

**❓ Key EDA Questions Answered**

📌 How many patients were admitted overall?

👨‍⚕️ What’s the gender breakdown?

👶 Which age groups are most frequently admitted?

🚨 What types of admissions are most common (Emergency vs Outpatient)?

📅 What are the busiest days of the week for admissions?

⚖️ Are there differences in admission types between genders?

📊 What trends can be visualized using charts and plots?
